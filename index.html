      <p>I’m the girl for the job. Previously a longtime English teacher by profession in the United Kingdom, I now reside permanently in Denmark, pursuing remote work that allows me to switch careers without compromising my desire to live abroad.</p>
      <p>But how am I qualified?</p>
      <p>I’ve developed a critical writing style with a keen eye for detail, and this began with my education at Brunel University, where I studied English with Creative Writing. This focus continued during my PGCE in Secondary English at the University of Reading, where I honed my precision through consistent feedback on student work. Writing comes naturally to me, and I spend my free time writing and editing novels for myself and friends, two of whom have been longlisted for the Chicken House Children’s Fiction competition. I also have experience in copywriting, having written and mentored at the YA Shot literature convention since its inception in 2015.
    </p>
      <p>I am ambitious and my professional training has cultivated an adventurous view of learning as a lifelong journey. In this way, I embrace change and seize new opportunities to broaden my horizons. It has enabled me to develop personal strategies to work efficiently, while maintaining high standards in content production, ultimately enhancing and improving my outcomes. I’m eager to dive into a new industry and build entirely new skillsets, continuing for years to come.</p>
      <p>I’m also familiar with Microsoft Office from my teaching experience, where I created numerous schemes of work and lesson plans using PowerPoint. Recently, I’ve started exploring HTML and CSS, using basic commands to customize templates and create simple websites with the guidance of a professional full-stack developer. I’m a quick study in IT and adept at finding solutions. In today’s fast-paced world of constant rebranding, I’ve fostered an eye for attractive web layout and design. Additionally, I have a passion for art and stylistic composition, which complements my design skills.</p>
